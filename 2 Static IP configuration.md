# Static IP Configuration

I won't document this process since it changes with each router (or DHCP device).

Procedure is to:
1. Connect to the network, preferrably with Ethernet cable for satable connection
2. Let DHCP assign IP address to the home server
3. Change DHCP to assign the same IP to the home server each time
